**Redis** (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source advanced NoSQL key-value data store used as a
database, cache, and message broker. The data is stored in a dictionary format having key-value pairs. It is
typically used for short term storage of data that needs fast retrieval. Redis does backup data to hard drives
to provide consistency.

The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that gives you complete access to Redisâ€™s data and its
functionalities if you are developing a software or tool that needs to interact with it.

There are different types of databases and one among them is **Redis**, which is an **'in-memory' database**. In-memory databases are the ones that rely essentially on the primary memory for data storage (meaning that the database is managed in the RAM of the system); in contrast to databases that store data on the disk or
SSDs

- ```redis-cli -h {target_IP}```
  -  info returns information and statistics about the Redis server

  - The keyspace section provides statistics on the main dictionary of each database. The statistics include the
number of keys, and the number of keys with an expiration
    - ```select #``` select which key from the keyspace (db0, *select 0*)
    - ```keys *``` list all the keys present in the database
    - ```get <key>``` view the values stored for a corresponding key
